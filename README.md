## 🔧 Installation & Usage
To compile and run the project, ensure you have a **C++ compiler** (such as g++ or clang++) installed.

```bash
# Compile the program
g++ -o neuroxor neuroxor.cpp -std=c++11

# Run the executable
./neuroxor
```

📌 **Pro Tip:** Experiment with different activation functions and hyperparameters to see how the network behaves!

## 📊 Training Visualization
Use Python to visualize training performance:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_accuracy(epochs, accuracy):
    plt.plot(epochs, accuracy, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.title('Neural Network Training Progress')
    plt.show()
```

📈 This script allows you to track model accuracy over time!

## ⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ **Data Handling:** Uses XOR gate training data.  
2️⃣ **Weight Initialization:** Implements He initialization for stability and Orthogonal Initialization for advanced scenarios.  
3️⃣ **Forward Propagation:** Computes hidden and output layers using the selected activation function.  
4️⃣ **Backpropagation:** Updates weights and biases using gradient descent.  
5️⃣ **Model Persistence:** Saves and loads model weights & biases to avoid retraining.  

📝 **Mathematical Representation:**
\[
y = f(W_2 \cdot f(W_1 \cdot x + b_1) + b_2)
\]

Where:
- \( W_1, W_2 \) = Weight matrices
- \( b_1, b_2 \) = Bias vectors
- \( f \) = Activation function
- \( x \) = Input vector

## 🎨 Activation Functions & Their Formulas
| Function | Formula | Best Use Case |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Sigmoid** | \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \) | Binary classification |
| **ReLU** | \( f(x) = max(0, x) \) | Deep networks |
| **Leaky ReLU** | \( f(x) = x > 0 ? x : 0.01x \) | Avoiding dead neurons |
| **Tanh** | \( f(x) = tanh(x) \) | Zero-centered data |

🔬 **Try different activation functions and observe their impact on training!**

## 💪 Advanced Features
### Gradient Flow Monitoring
Track how gradients propagate through layers to detect vanishing or exploding gradients. This helps debug and optimize the network.

### Dynamic Dropout Rate
The dropout rate adjusts dynamically based on training progress to prevent overfitting while maintaining model stability.

### Multi-Output Support
Extend the network to handle multi-output XOR-like problems for more complex tasks. This makes the network versatile for broader use cases.

### Early Stopping with Validation Set
Introduce a validation set to monitor generalization and stop training when overfitting occurs. This ensures the model doesn't waste computation on unnecessary epochs.
